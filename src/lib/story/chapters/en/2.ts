	content: `The roar from moments ago still echoed deep within my ears.  
My body twitched spasmodically.  
As if… I still hadn't grasped that I'd fallen.  

Something touched my body.  

I tried to move.  
But my body didn't respond at all.  

The feel of the ground was strange.  
Too smooth, too cold.

Even stone couldn't be this cold.  
Even the stones of ruins retain some warmth somewhere.  
The lingering trace of sunlight.  
The memory of wind.  
The faint imprint of a living being's body heat.  

…Yet this.  

Just cold.  
Just hard.  
As if no trace of life had ever existed here.

Sounds flowed in, fragmented.  
One moment, close.  
The next, distant.  

It was as if the world itself  
was wavering…  
whether to wake me,  
or to let me sink like this.

I tried to breathe, but my chest creaked deep inside.  
It hurt.  
As if my lungs were rejecting the air.

…Calm down.

I focused on my breathing.  
Inhale. Exhale.  
Counting should bring my thoughts back.

One.  
Two.  
…Three.

There, it broke off.

The fingers trying to count grasped at air.  
Consciousness slipped away.  
As if my very heart itself was being dragged far away.

For an instant…  
“I” nearly vanished.  

And then…  

The world shifted.  

---  

Sounds dissolved into the darkness.  

The sky was red.  

Explosions echoed in the distance.  

Guards gathered throughout the palace.  
Screams reached us from beyond the walls.  

…The situation was bad.

The intruders were advancing steadily.

I stood beside the teleportation gate.  
My mother was beside me.

At that instant…

Everything froze.

A low, heavy vibration shook the air.

The next moment,  
a blinding flash engulfed the world.

I reflexively…  
turned my gaze toward the ley line.

…It was gone.

What should have been there  
had vanished.

The structure crumbled, collapsing like dust.  
Quietly, quietly.  
Yet it felt as if the entire world was screaming.

…Stop.

Deep within my chest, something snapped.  
A feeling of being severed.  
Like a hole had been pierced through my soul…  
that sensation.

And then…

Someone's hand touched me.

---

Like being pulled from a distant nightmare,  
I woke up.

I felt coldness on my back.

The pain hadn't gone away.  
If anything, it was sharper than before.  
Like a blade remained lodged between my bones.

The sound was still there too.  
It hadn't completely faded.

My limbs trembled in tiny spasms.  
I couldn't tell if it was from cold or fear.

My vision returned all at once.

…Too vivid.  
…Too loud.

“#$+& #@%?”

The figure I'd seen earlier was peering down at me from above.

Close.  
…Too close.

They were saying something.  
But I couldn't understand a single word.

Sound has rules.  
It has structure.






I desperately searched my memory.  
My master's voice.  
The teachings of words.  
Foreign languages.  
The sound of incantations.  
The chanting of spells.

If it were some kind of “pattern,” I should be able to grasp it.  
The sequence of sounds.  
The pauses.  
The inflection.

…But it's different.

Similar, yet fundamentally different.  
With incantations, my inner self reacts.  
Just hearing the sound makes my chest tremble faintly.

This… nothing happens.  

Just a voice.  
Just words.  

Yet, I cannot understand them.  

His voice seemed tense.  
Speaking quickly, trying to convey something.  
Anxiety.  
Or perhaps, fear.  

My breath catches.  

…If he's an enemy.  

I have to escape.  
Right now.

Desperately, I scan my surroundings.  

Above me, it's pitch black, yet the area around me is unnaturally bright.  
The light reflects off the wet ground.  
“Stone” slippery from the cold rain…no, not stone, a smooth path.  

Wind blows through.  
It carries a faint, burnt-like smell.  
Smoke? Fire?  
Or…the scent of something I don't know.

Hovering high above was a giant slab of light.  
A square “window”.  
Inside, colors shifted.  
Patterns flowed.  
Things resembling letters were arranged.  

…Like spell characters.  

But no.  
There was absolutely no trace of magic.  
It just glowed, meaningless.  

And yet, my gaze was drawn to it.  
As if this world's “symbols” were observing me.

The metal beasts kept running as before.  
Each time they passed, puddles splashed.  
Fine droplets flew, stinging my cheeks.  
The roar echoed deep in my gut, making my body tremble.

…This is no place to stop.

Then…  
A narrow, dark passage caught my eye.  

Cramped.  
But it led underground.  
Beyond the entrance, stairs descending downward were faintly visible.  

…If it's that.  

Those beasts can't get in.  
A human body could slip through.  

His hand was still reaching for me.  

I don't know why.  

Maybe he was trying to help.  
Maybe he was trying to catch me.

Either way…  
I had no time to find out.  

I couldn't stay here.  

Before I could think, I shook off his hand and started running.  

A sharp pain shot through my leg.  
My lungs screamed.  
Cold wind and relentless rain lashed my face.  

It hurt.  
It was cold.  
I couldn't catch my breath.

Still, I couldn't stop.  

I darted into the passageway and looked back.  

…Nothing.  

He wasn't there anymore.  

The next instant, a tremendous roar fell from above.  
The ground shook.  
It felt like something incredibly huge had passed overhead.  

I held my breath in the darkness.  
I strained my ears.  
No footsteps.  
No sign of pursuit.

…Where am I?

…What does this mean?

Only one thing was clear.

I was…  
Lost.

From home.  
From the world.  
From everything.  
Far, far away.

Questions poured out, one after another.

But…  
Before that.  

I realized something far more terrifying.  

…I couldn't feel it.  

That sensation.  

Warmth.  
Pressure.  
The presence that should always have been inside me.  

Even when I reached deep into my chest,  
All that returned was an empty coldness.  

…No way.  

In this world…  
There are no ley lines……?`
