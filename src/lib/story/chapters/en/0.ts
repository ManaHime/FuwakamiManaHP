Stone and metal screamed beside me as the wall collapsed, shredded into dust.

“Luna! It saw us!”

A thin, slicing shriek tore through the air overhead.
A tendril of darkness whipped toward me fast, deliberate, hungry.

I jumped. The floor where I had stood ruptured with a violent crack.

Corruption writhed across the impact point.
Stone decayed as if rotting alive, shadow-tendrils crawling over it like a nest of starving creatures.

The monster spread its warped wings and rose, kicking dust into a spiraling storm.
More tendrils lashed downward.
My hand moved before thought could catch up.

Light burst from my palm and scattered the nearest shadows.

The recoil hit me like a blade.

“—nh!”

My knees faltered. Pain climbed my ribs and crawled up my spine.
Too much.
I knew I had no business using this power in my current state.

But we were out of time.

“Luna! More incoming!”

I looked up—and froze.

The sky was crowded with them.
Dozens. Maybe hundreds.
Their bodies flickered like broken reflections, warping as if the world refused to hold their shapes.
My chest tightened just seeing them.

They had heard the clash.
I had been careless.

And now my friends were paying for it.

A shockwave slammed through the air.
A building beside us shattered, blown apart into glittering dust and fragments.

My breath caught.

They had followed me here.
All of this…
Every terrifying moment…
was because of me.

Earth was never meant to face creatures like these.

“Run!”

I screamed the word as loud as my voice would carry.

The shadows surged toward us.

My legs trembled. My vision shook.
There was no time left.

I reached inward…

…and found nothing.

A hollow.
A wound.
The same empty place that had stalked me since my world died.

No.
Not now.

Deeper.

I pushed through the pain.

Deeper.

Heat crawled up my spine. My vision blurred. My body shuddered.
The shadows screamed—an echo of the death of Venus itself.
My friends struggled for breath behind me; I could feel their panic like a second heartbeat.

Deeper—!

And then…

…the hollow vanished.

Warmth surged through my chest, sharp enough to steal my breath.
Something long-lost snapped back into alignment inside me.
The ground steadied beneath my feet.

The creatures drifted around me in warped, slowed arcs, as though time itself hesitated.

I moved.

In a heartbeat I was above the first creature.
The blade of light in my hand cut through its body like slicing through mist.

Another.
And another.

I slipped between tendrils before they fully formed, striking faster than thought.
The air cracked with each impact.
Shockwaves rolled across the ground, but the noise felt impossibly distant.

For the first time in so long, I felt connected.

The final creature dissolved into smoke.

Silence.

Then agony tore through me—so fierce I couldn’t breathe.

My vision shattered.
My legs collapsed.
Something inside me opened—and kept breaking apart.

A scream ripped from my throat.

My friends ran toward me.
The world spun and smeared into colors.

I tried to form words…

but my strength vanished.

The last thing I heard was my name, shouted again and again…

…and everything went black.`
